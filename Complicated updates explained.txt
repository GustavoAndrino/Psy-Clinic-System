***Login page explained***
The app was at first completed, and it owuld be distributed as a file to install. But after some careful thought, I realized that
it would be a lot better to make a login system, and put the system online. Allthough it will make me do a lot more work to create 
authentication systems, this methods allow users to test the system, with a 20 actions/day limit. So it would be better for new 
people to test it, and for recruiters to look at my project. Hence, I have started making the login feature today (01/21/2025)


***OLD***
***Add new Session to patient explained***

Adding a session to a patient resulted in a lot of alterations, due to the fact that de LocalDateTime from the backend no having
a specified JsonFormat expected before. By adding a expected format (dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm), I had to make some changes to update patient 
and some alterations to the viewPacient page. Currently, the viewPacient.js looks extermely crowed with a lot of functions. 
Cleaning it up is a priority for next commit, in which I will separete the components for better readability


***SEARCH BAR UPDATE EXPLAINED***

As I decided to implement a search bar, the way I first did the backend made it really hard to handle the requests,
since the backend received an input and returend a Optionl<Pacient> object, which is in essence, a single object, 
not an array of objects. This method of returning caused react to crash, since it was expecting an array of Pacients.

In order to fix it and make it easier, a new repository query was created, that returned a list of pacients that had their name
or their dependent name starting with a string. This is not very efficient, but since a clinic shouldnt have so many 
clients to the point that this strategy would be prejudicial, then the method should work fine.

Changing the backend caused a problem with forntend requests, that were still trying to use the old '/pacient' method 
that returned string based on whatever type of string the user input (cpf, name or id).

In order to fix that, I splitted the previous method into a new /pacient that returns a list of users that contain
a string (in case there is no string, then it returns all patients) and a new /pacientById method that returns Patients
based on the id that the front end gives. This allowed us to use a search bar to find patients more easily and allow us
to click on that user to see more details based on their id.

***TO DO***

Change Pacients for Patients. I kept the idea of patients in portuguese in my head (Pacientes) and mixed both
Alter controller in backend returning a response entity, instead of just returning the service that returns a response entity
Separate components by function in the front end to improve readability for other users (*DONE*)
